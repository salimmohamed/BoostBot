# Commit Message Style Rule

When generating commit messages, always follow this format:

**Format:** `feat: short descriptive title`

**Body:** Bullet points describing specific changes:
- Use action verbs (Remove, Add, Fix, Update, Simplify, etc.)
- Be specific about what was changed
- Focus on the most important changes
- Keep bullet points concise but descriptive
- Group related changes together

**Examples:**
- `feat: add user authentication system`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in data processing`
- `refactor: simplify API response handling`
- `feat: humanize codebase and remove dead code`

**Guidelines:**
- Keep title under 50 characters
- Use lowercase after the colon
- Be specific about the type of change (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
- Focus on what the user/developer will notice
- Avoid technical jargon in the title
- Use bullet points for detailed changes in the body
