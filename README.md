# Discord Auto-Responder Bot

## Why I Built This

I play World of Warcraft and wanted to get into boosting (helping other players for gold). The popular boosting communities post keys in Discord channels and it's first-come-first-serve. I was tired of missing opportunities because I couldn't respond fast enough, so I built this bot to automatically reply when certain keywords are posted.

## What It Does

- **Monitors Discord channels** for specific keywords (like "key" or "boost")
- **Automatically responds** with your pre-written message
- **Works in specific channels** only (so you don't spam everywhere)
- **Easy GUI** to set up keywords and responses
- **Role mention detection** - responds when specific roles are mentioned
- **Channel filtering** - restrict bot to only certain channels

## Features

- **Keyword Detection**: Automatically detects specified keywords in messages
- **Role Mention Detection**: Responds when specific roles are mentioned
- **Channel Filtering**: Restrict bot responses to specific channels only
- **Customizable Responses**: Set custom responses for each keyword and role
- **Case Sensitivity**: Toggle case-sensitive keyword matching
- **Self-Response Control**: Choose whether to respond to your own messages
- **Reply Mode**: Choose between replying to messages or sending new ones
- **Modern GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use CustomTkinter interface for configuration
- **Process Management**: Start/stop bot with proper cleanup and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid Discord rate limits
- **Multi-Instance Protection**: Prevents multiple bot instances from running

## Quick Setup

1. **Install Python packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If you're using Python 3.13+, you may need to install additional packages:
```bash
pip install legacy-cgi audioop-lts
```

2. **Get your Discord token** (Google "how to get Discord token")

3. **Run the GUI:**
```bash
python gui.py
```

4. **Set up your bot:**
   - Put your Discord token in the Configuration tab
   - Add keywords like "key", "boost", "carry" in the Keywords tab
   - Add your response like "I can do this! DM me"
   - Add the channel IDs where boosting keys are posted
   - Click Start Bot

## How It Works

1. Bot watches the channels you specify
2. When someone posts a message with your keywords
3. Bot automatically replies with your message
4. You get notified and can DM the person

## Example Use Case

**Keywords to watch for:**
- "key" ‚Üí "I can do this key! DM me"
- "boost" ‚Üí "I'm available for boosting! DM me"
- "carry" ‚Üí "I can carry this! DM me"

**Channels to monitor:**
- Boosting community channels
- Key trading channels
- Carry service channels

## Configuration

The bot uses `config.json` for all settings. The GUI automatically creates and manages this file.

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE",
    "keywords": {
        "key": "I can do this key! DM me",
        "boost": "I'm available for boosting! DM me",
        "carry": "I can carry this! DM me"
    },
    "case_sensitive": false,
    "respond_to_self": false,
    "reply_to_message": true,
    "role_mentions": {
        "123456789012345678": "This role was mentioned!"
    },
    "allowed_channels": ["123456789012345678"]
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **token**: Your Discord user token
- **keywords**: Dictionary of keyword ‚Üí response pairs
- **case_sensitive**: Whether keyword matching is case-sensitive
- **respond_to_self**: Whether to respond to your own messages
- **reply_to_message**: Whether to reply to original message or send new one
- **role_mentions**: Dictionary of role ID ‚Üí response pairs
- **allowed_channels**: List of channel IDs where bot should respond (empty = all channels)

## How to Use

### 1. Keywords
- Add keywords and responses in the Keywords tab
- Bot will automatically detect these keywords in messages
- Supports case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching

### 2. Role Mentions
- Get role IDs by right-clicking roles ‚Üí Copy ID (requires Developer Mode)
- Add role IDs and responses in the Role Mentions tab
- Bot responds when those roles are mentioned in messages

### 3. Channel Filtering
- Get channel IDs by right-clicking channels ‚Üí Copy ID (requires Developer Mode)
- Add channel IDs in the Channels tab
- Leave empty to listen in all channels
- Bot only responds in specified channels

### 4. Bot Control
- Use the Start/Stop buttons to control the bot
- View live logs in the Bot Control tab
- Bot automatically cleans up when stopped

## Getting IDs

### Channel ID
1. Right-click the channel name
2. Select "Copy ID" (requires Developer Mode)

### Role ID
1. Right-click the role name in the server member list
2. Select "Copy ID" (requires Developer Mode)

### Enable Developer Mode
1. User Settings ‚Üí Advanced
2. Toggle "Developer Mode" on

## Safety Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid Discord detection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues
- **Configuration Validation**: Automatic validation of all settings
- **Process Management**: Proper cleanup and lock file management
- **Channel Restrictions**: Limit bot activity to specific channels

## Important Notes

- **Configuration Changes**: After modifying settings in the GUI, restart the bot to apply changes
- **Token Security**: Never share your Discord token
- **Channel Restrictions**: If no channels are specified, bot listens in ALL channels
- **Process Locking**: Only one bot instance can run at a time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This is a self-bot (uses your personal account). Discord doesn't like self-bots and could ban your account. Use at your own risk!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Another bot instance is already running"**
   - Check if bot is running in another terminal
   - Delete `bot.lock` file if it exists

2. **"Invalid token"**
   - Verify your token is correct
   - Get a fresh token using the browser method

3. **Bot not responding**
   - Check if channel is in allowed_channels list
   - Verify keywords are correctly configured
   - Check bot logs in the GUI

4. **Python 3.13+ compatibility issues**
   - Install `legacy-cgi` and `audioop-lts` packages

## Files

- `gui.py` - The easy-to-use interface
- `bot.py` - The bot that does the work
- `config.json` - Your settings (auto-created)
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages needed

## That's It!

Super simple - just run the GUI, set up your keywords and responses, pick your channels, and start the bot. Now you'll never miss a boosting opportunity again! üéØ
